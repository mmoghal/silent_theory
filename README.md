# Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

I have completed a web development challenge that involved building a portfolio page using HTML, CSS, flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. This portfolio showcases my work and highlights my thought processes behind it. I have also created deployed web applications, which are live on the web and can be used as examples of my work. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in web development and highlight my ability to create engaging, functional websites.

As a web developer, I am always looking for ways to expand my skill set and learn new technologies. I am passionate about creating intuitive, visually appealing websites that deliver an exceptional user experience. If you are interested in learning more about my work or discussing potential projects, please feel free to get in touch with me.
